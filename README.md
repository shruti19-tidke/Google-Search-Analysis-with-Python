# Google-Search-Analysis-with-Python
This project demonstrates how to collect, analyze, and visualize real-world trend data using Python. It combines data analysis + visualization + real-world application → making it a strong Data Analyst portfolio project.
Project Overview: Google Search Analysis with Python
🔎 Introduction

The project uses Google Trends data to analyze public interest in specific topics.

Since Google doesn’t provide a direct API, the project uses PyTrends, an unofficial Python library, to fetch the data.

Data is analyzed and visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

🎯 Objectives

The project aims to answer key data-driven questions:

How popular is a specific keyword globally?

Which countries search most for that keyword?

How has the interest changed over time?

How do multiple keywords compare in terms of popularity?

Can we visualize search interest on a world map for better insights?

🛠 Tools & Libraries

PyTrends → Fetches Google Trends data.

Pandas → Data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Static data visualizations (line plots, bar charts).

Plotly → Interactive charts (especially world maps).

📊 Key Components

Keyword Analysis

Fetch Google Trends data for a chosen keyword.

Example: “Cloud Computing”.

Top Countries (Interest by Region)

Get top 15 countries where the keyword is searched most.

Display results in a bar chart.

World Map Visualization

Use Plotly Choropleth to plot global search interest by country.

Makes it easy to see which regions are most engaged.

Time-wise Interest (Trend Over Time)

Extract search interest data across months/years.

Plot a time series line chart to show how the keyword’s popularity changes.

Keyword Comparison

Compare multiple keywords (e.g., “Cloud Computing”, “Data Science”, “Machine Learning”).

Plot them on the same graph to compare trends.

🌍 Applications

Market Research → Companies can see demand for products/services.

SEO & Digital Marketing → Understand which keywords are trending.

Political Forecasting → Track public interest in political figures/events.

Media & Journalism → Monitor trending topics worldwide.

Academic Research → Study changes in public awareness of technologies.

📈 Expected Outcomes

Clear visual insights on how interest in keywords changes globally and over time.

Ability to compare different topics to see which one is more popular.

Interactive visual maps and graphs to communicate findings effectively.
